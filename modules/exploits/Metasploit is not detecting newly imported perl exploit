Metasploit is not detecting newly imported perl exploit
 
 I download a exploit 1244.pl
 
 have placed it under the directory /.msf4/modules/exploits/webapp/php and made it executable. Then I ran the command updatedb.

In my locally placed exploit-database it was under the directory exploits/webapp/php 

Before adding and after adding the new one it should have got increased, but it remained the same. It does not detect the new one.

I have also tried running msfupdate, I thought updating the whole framework could change something. But its all the same.

Version 

I'm running metasploit v5.0.68-dev

I have installed with kali

VM


Thanks for help.
